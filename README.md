# Homework 2: Project Scaffolding Reflection

## How many hours did you spend working on this homework?

 >12 hours

## What challenges/roadblocks did you face during this homework?

Reading documentation, trying to genuinly understand documentation was extremely confusing, took hours and hours for me to throughly understand if at all, expects me to have prior knowledge, guides often did not include information about packages it only works with in parallel. I hope that there is more hand-holding in the next iteration of this class or if not just more writeup, I really felt like i was left on my own to configure almost everything, I didn't really even understand that packages needed to be configured, nor how ESModules worked with typescript and jest, Please leave more write up next time.


## Did you use AI/LLM tools for this assignment? If so, please provide a transcript or document your usage extensively below. If you did use AI, please explain why you decided to use AI for the task you used it for, what you learned from the AI responses, and explain any relevant unfamiliar terms and concepts that the AI responses generated.

Debug why npm not letting my download json from other file, what I'm supposed to put in name/version/etc in my package.json, understnading a lot of errors stemming from downloading packages, understanding what errors meant, and trying to understand documentation for various packages

I used AI because the documentation was too spread out and too confused to synthesize amongst other packages.

I was also extremely busy this week so i didn't start on the homework till thursday, otherwise I wouldn've gone to office hours.
